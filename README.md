# The "Payman": students payments management system

This is a legacy project implemented inside Moodle LMS (https://moodle.org) and now being in need for refactoring out to become a standalone PHP web application.
The project is built using the Domain Driven Design and framework-independence approaches. Its purpose is to learn how much the DDD can be beneficial, and how much it's possible to keep the core application code distant from a PHP framework.
